GeoByte, Inc
… Optimized Delivery
General Requirement
GeoByte Inc is a leading courier and logistics company with focus on safe and fast delivery of
items to destinations across the globe.
With recent global developments that have affected the ease and cost of moving packages
across cities and countries, they want to optimize their delivery costs and speed of delivery in
order to stay afloat.
GeoByte Inc needs a software solution, accessible from their browsers where they can set up
locations, select an origin and destination location and view the best route to take in delivering
packages from the origin to the destination.
Your Task
You are to develop a simple web application that will allow any staff of GeoByte Inc
➢ register (with name, email and password) or log in (with email and password)
➢ View a list of delivery locations
➢ Add | Remove | Update delivery locations (minimum of 3 locations must exist before
deliveries can start)
➢ Select any two different locations (origin and destination), and generate the optimal route
to take in delivering a package, together with the cost of delivery. This is represented as
a sequence of locations from origin to destination

Version 1.0
Assumptions / Constraints:
- All packages are same size and weight
- Only 1 package can be delivered at a time
- All locations where the package gets to, except the origin location incur a fixed clearing
cost between $25 - $100 inclusive. The clearing cost of a location is defined when the
location is being added
- No location is visited more than once while delivering a package
- The package must pass at least 1 intermediate location before getting to the final
destination and at most 4
- Cost per package per kilometer = $1.00
- The total cost of delivery, C T is defined as
C T = sum(C D ) + sum(C C ) ,
Where:
C D = Cost per kilometer * Total distance (in km) from origin to destination
C C = Clearing cost per location visited, including the destination
Tools / Technologies
➢ The software should have a RESTful API backend written with Java/Spring and a
frontend written with Angular 6 or higher
➢ For persistence, use JPA and H2 database
Bonus Points
Bonus points for:
● Also displaying the most expensive route and highest cost of delivery, given the
assumptions and constraints specified in the earlier section
● Test coverage: Unit and integration test coverage for both the frontend and backend.
